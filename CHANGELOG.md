# Changelog

All notable changes to the `agent-coherence` Claude Code plugin are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions adhere to [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Alpha — APIs and the `hooks.json` wire shape may change before `v1.0`.

The canonical release-notes surface is [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hipvlady/agent-coherence-plugin/releases); this file mirrors that history in a structured format for operators who prefer a single browsable timeline.

## [Unreleased]

No unreleased work yet — `v0.2.0` (broad-beta launch) shipped on 2026-05-24.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-24 (broad-beta launch)

**Broad-beta milestone.** The 2026-05-23 plan deepening flipped the v0.1.1 G12 alpha-cohort gating to "open broad beta with explicit risk acceptance" — v0.1.1 has been publicly installable from the marketplace catalog and no cohort blockers have surfaced via the catalog smoke installs. v0.2 ships strict mode atop that baseline.

### Added — strict mode

- **Per-artifact strict-mode opt-in** via `.coherence/strict_mode.yaml` (same shape as `tracked.yaml` + `ignored.yaml`). Intersection semantics with `tracked_paths` per KTD-O; a path is in strict mode iff it is tracked AND matches at least one strict-mode glob. Default empty preserves v0.1.1 warn-mode for every artifact.
- **Hook handler decision-flip** across all 4 PreToolUse handlers (Read, Edit / Write via shared `Edit|Write` matcher, Bash, Grep). When (strict + tracked + invalidated), the hook returns `permissionDecision: "deny"` with a static reason text byte-stable across retries per KTD-P / Phase 0 H1 falsification.
- **`TERMINAL_DENIAL_CLASSES` structural invariant** in the library coordinator — any code path emitting `permissionDecision: "allow"` must route through `emit_allow()` which refuses to convert strict-mode denials. Parameterized integration test + AST-based meta-test guard against future regression.
- **`agent-coherence-migrate-deny` console script** (v0.9.0+) — stricter sibling to v0.1.1's `agent-coherence-migrate-rules`. STDOUT-only (never writes settings.json), symlink-contained (canonical-path containment check refuses files outside the workspace root), never invokes an LLM. Under-emit bias: only canonical phrasings trigger.
- **Strict-mode telemetry** — `strict_mode_denials_total`, `strict_mode_routed_around_via_bash_total` (Phase 0 H4 routing pattern detector with 30s window), `audit_log_mode_drift_total` counters surfaced via `/status?detail=metrics`. Minimal denial-only audit log appended as JSONL to `.coherence/audit.log` (mode 0o600, no schema_version, no command bodies, no user content).

### Added — broad-beta launch package

- **README depth-parity overhaul** (149 → 335 lines) following the EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin section sequence: Philosophy + Quick Example + expanded Commands table + Strict Mode + Architecture + Local Development + FAQ + About Contributions. Plugin README is the broad-beta launch surface for first-time operators.
- **`docs/BROAD_BETA.md`** — BB1-BB8 launch-readiness rubric (replaces the v0.1.1 G12 alpha-cohort hold), 14-day post-launch monitoring procedure, rollback runbook.
- **Canonical un-pinned install** — `/plugin marketplace add hipvlady/agent-coherence-plugin` resolves to the latest published catalog tag. Pinned-version install (`@v0.2.0`) documented as the secondary path for operators who need version stability.
- **Public-feedback intake hardening** — 3 issue templates (bug / feature / install-troubleshooting), 4 seeded Discussion templates, `security@agent-coherence.dev` alias provisioned (closes the v0.1.1 SECURITY.md `TODO (v0.2)` item), CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant 2.1), CONTRIBUTING.md (maintainer-curated PR posture, 72h triage SLA on bugs), PRIVACY.md (explicit no-telemetry).
- **`CHANGELOG.md` at repo root** (this file) — Keep-a-Changelog format, mirrors GitHub Releases for operators who want a single browsable timeline.

### Changed

- **`hook.secret` rotation is MANDATORY on v0.2 upgrade** per KTD-W. Secrets generated under v0.1.1's warn-mode threat model gate v0.2's strict-mode hard guardrails — inherited entropy is insufficient to bridge the upgrade. Documented in [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) section 4 and the README FAQ. Procedure: stop running `claude` sessions → `rm <repo>/.coherence/hook.secret` → restart any `claude` session, which lazy-spawns the coordinator and generates a fresh 32-byte secret.
- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` description** — removed "Warn-only in v0.1.1" framing now that v0.2 ships strict mode.

### Backend compatibility

- **Strict mode is Python-coordinator-only in v0.2.** Workspaces using `coherence.coordinator_backend = "node"` stay warn-mode. v0.3 brings the strict-mode wire shape to the Node coordinator behind the multi-target converter plan.
- Library version requirement: `agent-coherence>=0.8.0` for warn mode; `agent-coherence>=0.9.0` for strict mode (the v0.9.0 library release ships the wire-shape additions).

### Known limitations

See the README [v0.2 known limitations](README.md#v02-known-limitations) table for the full list. Most-relevant for broad-beta operators:

- Native Windows still requires WSL2 (`fcntl` constraint).
- Bypass classes: interpreters outside the `bash_path_detector` list (`ruby -e`, `node -e`, `perl -pe`), shell-redirect reads (`tee < file`), and `diff /dev/null file` patterns can read strict-tracked artifacts. The migration helper closes the interpreter class via `permissions.deny`; shell-redirect and diff-as-reader are terminal limitations or v0.2.x backlog.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-23

**Marketplace cohort listing.** Promotes the v0.1.0-alpha.1 private alpha to a publicly-installable marketplace catalog entry. Single-command install via `/plugin marketplace add hipvlady/agent-coherence-plugin@v0.1.1` + `/plugin install agent-coherence@agent-coherence`. Ships with full 78-finding ce-review remediation pass against the library.

### Added — Node MESI-subset coordinator

- **One-click marketplace install** via the Node coordinator backend (`coherence.coordinator_backend = "node"`). Mirrors the Python coordinator's HTTP wire contract; both backends share the `hook.secret` exchange and `server.pid` lazy-spawn semantics. Switch via `agent-coherence-coordinator --prepare-for-migration` for safe Python ↔ Node transitions.
- **Multi-tool hook routing (H4 mitigation)** — `hooks.json` matchers cover `Read`, `Edit|Write`, `Bash`, `Grep`. Closes the model-routing-around-Read pattern Phase 0 confirmed (model retries denied Read 2-5 times then falls back to `bash cat plan.md`).
- **AC-02 + AC-03 wire-shape parity** — Node and Python coordinators emit aligned `/status` shapes: `coordinator_uptime_seconds` (canonical name, full-word `_seconds` suffix), `sessions[].agent_name` + `sessions[].states` (per-agent MESI snapshot).

### Added — operator-facing tooling

- **`agent-coherence-status --self-test`** — post-install 4-step pre-read → pre-edit → post-edit → stale-pre-read smoke. Exit 0 on pass, 3 with actionable diagnostic on fail. The single-best signal that the install wired up hooks correctly.
- **`agent-coherence-coordinator --prepare-for-migration`** — atomic draining state that releases all M/E grants + rejects new pre-edit (HTTP 503) + shuts down. Eliminates silent data-loss races when switching Python ↔ Node backends.

### Security

- **Bearer-token auth** on every coordinator endpoint with constant-time comparison (`crypto.timingSafeEqual` / `hmac.compare_digest`). Token stored as `<repo>/.coherence/hook.secret` mode `0600`, created atomically via `O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL`.
- **Host-header allowlist** (`localhost` / `127.0.0.1` only) rejects DNS-rebinding from non-loopback origins before token comparison.
- **R12 three-tier `/status` disclosure** — default `minimal` tier is safe to paste in bug reports (no absolute paths, no PIDs, no session identifiers); `?detail=metrics` adds telemetry; `?detail=full` requires `Coherence-Local-Operator: true` opt-in header for the elevated tier.
- **R21 64KB request body cap** + **R11 bounded `O_EXCL` retry** on empty-secret recovery (fail-closed after 5 attempts).
- **CycloneDX SBOM** attached to every GitHub Release via `release.yml`.

### Plugin coexistence

- `package.json` is `"private": true` by design. Distribution is via the Claude Code marketplace catalog, not npm. The plugin is consumed via `/plugin marketplace add hipvlady/agent-coherence-plugin@v0.1.1`, which clones the tagged Git ref directly.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] — 2026-05-18

**Private alpha — direct-install (not marketplace catalog).**

Initial Python-coordinator-only release for the ~10 hand-picked alpha cohort. Two-step install (`pip install agent-coherence>=0.8.0a1` + `claude plugin install --from-dir <checkout>`). Plugin and library coexist in the cohort installer's environment.

### Added

- **Warn-only stale-read warnings** via the Python coordinator's `additionalContext` injection on PreToolUse (Read / Edit / Write surfaces; Bash / Grep added in v0.1.1).
- **Lazy-spawned local HTTP coordinator** at `<repo>/.coherence/` wrapping SQLite-WAL. 15-minute idle-shutdown; SQLite state rehydrates on next spawn.
- **MESI cache-coherence subset** — single-writer-multi-reader semantics on tracked artifacts. Cross-session invalidation on commit.
- **Phase 0 falsifiability experiment scaffolding** (`docs/probes/2026-05-19-ktd-e-falsifiability/`) — set the stage for the v0.2 strict-mode design (H4 confirmed, H1 + H3 falsified).
